Text based adventure game

At the moment this is a work in progress but I would like to share what I've accomplished so far.

There is no setting for this mini text based game. You simply encounter a monster and attack it following the on-screen instructions.

In the comming revisions... Weapons (Types and damage) Dynamic Monster Health Leveling System Loot System
